Computational methods on financial math

* My first Jupyter notebook by Colab: [ipynb](src/first_notebook_v01.ipynb)

Homework assignments:
* HW 1, GitHub+Colab Setup: [ipynb](src/homework1_v01.ipynb)

# HW 2
* Part 1, Second order finite difference operator: [ipynb](src/hw2_second_fd_v01.ipynb)
* Part 2, Finite difference operator with higher order convergence: [ipynb](src/hw2_ex_fd_v02.ipynb)

# HW 3
* Part 1, Graphing Payoffs of Option Portfolios: [ipynb](src/hw3_option_combinations_v02.ipynb)
* Part 2, Implied Volatility: [ipynb](src/hw3_implied_volatility_v02.ipynb)

# HW 4
* Part 1, BSM Calibration: [ipynb](src/hw4_bsm_calibration_v02.ipynb)
* Part 2, BSM Geometric Asian Option Pricing: [ipynb](src/hw4_bsm_geometric_asian_option_v02.ipynb)

# HW 5
* Part 1, Monte Carlo Proofs: [ipynb](src/hw5_mc_01_v02.ipynb)
* Part 2, Monte Carlo Approximation of pi: [ipynb](src/hw5_mc_02_v02.ipynb)

# HW 6
* Part 1, Ordinary Monte Carlo Definite Integrals: [ipynb](src/hw6_omc_integral_v01.ipynb)
* Part 2, Inverse Transform and Importance Sampling: [ipynb](src/hw6_is_it_integral_v01.ipynb)
* Part 3, BSM, AAC, and Exact Sampling: [ipynb](src/hw6_exact_sample_v01.ipynb)

# HW 7
* Part 1, Correlations to AAC: [ipynb](src/hw7_correlations_to_aac_v02.ipynb)
* Part 2, Exact Sampling: BSM + Knock-in: [ipynb](src/hw7_es_bsm_knock_in_v02.ipynb)
* Part 3, Vasicek Model Calibration: [ipynb](src/hw7_vasicek_calibration_v04.ipynb)

Note: IPYNB files are acting very weird lately. Sometimes .ipynb pages don't load at all. If it doesn't load when you go to open it, go to this site https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ and paste the URLs above in (i.e. to view 7-2, go to the page meant for 7-2, copy that page's URL, and paste it into the prompted box on the nbviewer site) to view the actual Jupyter Notebook page.

# HW 8
* Part 1, Fourier Transform Method: [ipynb](src/hw8_1_v03.ipynb)
* Part 2, Heston Models: [ipynb](src/hw8_2_heston_pricing_v02.ipynb)
* Part 3, Derivation of the Characteristic Function: [ipynb](src/hw8_3_derivation_of_characteristic_function_v02.ipynb)

# HW 10
(HW 9 is not present here as it is simply an initial report on my final project.)
* Part 1, FTCS and Stability in a Heat Equation: [ipynb](src/hw10_heat_ftcs.ipynb)
* Part 2, FTCS Stability Questions: [ipynb](src/hw10_ftcs_stability.ipynb)
* Part 3, 2-Dimensional Ito: [ipynb](src/hw10_2d_ito.ipynb)

Note: Previewing part 3 makes it look peculiar/incomplete (may be a result of me trying to read it right after pushing it live). If it seems incomplete then I recommend either using the nbviewer site I linked above from when my HW7/8 were having issues, or viewing it directly in Colab.

# HW 11
* Part 1, CRR Convergence: [ipynb](src/hw11_crr_v01.ipynb)
* Part 2, BTCS Stability in a Heat Equation: [ipynb](src/hw11_btcs_stability_head_1d_v01.ipynb)

# HW 12
* Part 1, Importance Sampling with a Digital Option: [ipynb](src/hw12_v01.ipynb)

# Final Project
A larger-scale implied volatility program (compared to previous works done in class), using real data from Bloomberg: [ipynb](src/MA573_Project_Larger_Scale_IV_Calculation_v05.ipynb)
