# HW 7
* Part 1, Correlations to AAC: ***WORK IN PROGRESS*** (Need to research Variance Reduction)
* Part 2, Exact Sampling: BSM + Knock-in: [ipynb](src/hw7_es_bsm_knock_in_v02.ipynb)
* Part 3, Vasicek Model Calibration: [ipynb](src/hw7_vasicek_calibration_v03.ipynb)

Note: IPYNB files are acting very weird lately. Sometimes .ipynb pages don't load at all. If it doesn't load when you go to open it, go to this site https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ and paste the URLs above in (i.e. to view 7-2, go to the page meant for 7-2, copy that page's URL, and paste it into the prompted box on the nbviewer site) to view the actual Jupyter Notebook page.

# HW 8
* Part 1, Fourier Transform Method: [ipynb](src/hw8_1_v03.ipynb)
* Part 2, Heston Models: [ipynb](src/hw8_2_heston_pricing_v01.ipynb)
* Part 3, Derivation of the Characteristic Function: ***WORK IN PROGRESS*** (Possible overlap concern with first proof - may copy over)
